# Dynamic Response Overhaul
_a Stardew Valley dialogue mod, by CelestialFirestorm_

.

## Known Issues:
`divorce`: If you divorce `Character B` after having previously divorced `Character A`, `Character A` will react with the same dialogue they used after their own divorce. I'm looking into it. (Maybe your new divorce just brings up painful memories, I dunno)
  - for now, `divorce` dialogue is more general to make it less awkward

## Future Plans:
Once all the dialogue is finished, there are no more plans for DRO -- at least on my end. If any of its dependencies update with new functionality, I will also update DRO to take advantage. Short of that, and bugfixes as necessary, when it's done, it's done.

**Stats As Tokens:**
  - pull the name of a random animal from `Player`'s farm when gifting Artisan Goods
    - _function currently broken; Stats As Tokens needs to update_

## Changelog:
**0.0.9:**
  - basic functions... functional. it lives!
